random backgrounds on refresh?


- To avoid compromising a personal password, I created a placeholder GitHub account and hard-coded the credentials for the API calls.

// link out to issues?

//change h2 to be user's name (dynamically)

Only show 5 repos at a time?
//add a button to only see open issues vs all

// for profile page, show contents only if not undefined
// in mobile view, hide contents and have a "show more details" button
//placeholder image for missing profile pics?

//add a loading for getting the issues?


//once you open/close an issue, card needs to update
